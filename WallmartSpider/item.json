Introducing the 20\" Boy 's Schwinn Fierce, a kid-friendly sidewalk bike with Schwinn SmartStart geometry, which means the bike has been carefully designed to match a kid 's body type to make riding more comfortable and pedaling easier on tiny legs. Other kids bikes are just shrunken down versions of adult bikes, so typically the grips are too large, the pedals are too wide and the seats are too big. On SmartStart bikes, the grips are smaller to match smaller hands, the gears are recalibrated for more power with less pedaling effort, and the pedals are closer together to fit a child 's hips. Pedaling is more streamlined for better leverage, less knee pressure and less waddling on young legs. Like all Schwinns, the Shine comes with a limited lifetime warranty for as long as you own the bike. Start your kid out riding the Smart way on the Schwinn Fierce!   Schwinn SmartStart geometry creates the perfect fit and provides more control and stability for young riders  Seat and grips are designed smaller to fit a child 's proportions for a more comfortable ride  Narrow pedal width is sized to fit a child 's hips  Kid-specific saddle and relaxed seat tube angle allow proper leg extension for easier pedaling  Rear coaster brake with front and rear hand brakes helps young riders learn to use big kid brakes  Tool-free adjustable seat post lets your child grow with the bike  Laser-printed seat and handlebar pad add sweet style and flair ",

This method can still work, but balance bikes are designed to create balancing skills better than a tricycle can. Using a balance bike removes the need to pedal, teaching the child to push with their legs and glide, like using a seated scooter. Once they are old enough to ride a tricycle, they are old enough to get on a balance bike. You won 't believe how fast your little one can go and how quickly they will learn how to ride when finally introduced to a pedal bike! For such a simple bike, the Skip 3 has great features, like a lightweight steel frame that is low enough for a child 's foot to rest on the ground, air-filled tires and spoked wheels with coordinating rims, a durable handlebar and stem, and a tool-free adjustable seat post.

You dragged it around, because that what’s kids do – it was light enough to drag where ever you wanted it to go. But of course, there were times of frustration when you threw it to the ground! Because your bike was strong enough to take a beating from any toddler trying to ride like the big kids. And, it was cool - in your favorite color, of course. Being light, strong and cool - you would ride it for hours! And so we designed the GOMO with one purpose in mind – to Get Kids Out More Often. The GOMO Is Strong, Light, Safe and Cool. And, It’s Adjustable to Grow Up With Them Too!\"   JUST LIKE A BIG KIDS BIKE! Do you remember your first toddler bike? It needed to be light enough to drag, but strong enough for those moments of frustration when you threw it to the ground! It had to be safe, but of course, look cool too! So naturally we packed all that into the GOMO, so your kids can fondly remember their first bike too!  SAFETY FIRST: The GOMO kids bicycle has a turn limiter for greater control while they master the skill of steering. The custom footrest lets them place their feet safely as they go fast for their very first time. Through-Wheel Axles stop wheels from falling off while the padded seat lets kids hit their first tiny “all terrain bumps” without jarring.  STURDY ENOUGH TO GROW WITH THEM! To ride like the big kids’, there’ll be a few spills along the way. So we gave the GOMO push bike a Steel Frame that’s as light as it is tough. It’s the first bike that grows with kids and their confidence! The adjustable seat allows for a ride height 12” – 17.5” and grows from 18 months to 5 years; and up to 60lbs.  LIGHTWEIGHT: GOMO means “Get Out More Often”, so we’ve made this boys and girls bike 6.4 pounds - light enough to do exactly that! Toddlers can lift and drag it, just as easily as they can scoot along. The 14.6” T-Bar with its special GOMO Grips are easy for little hands to grab while the 12” Heavy Duty Wheels, can be dragged over gravel without punctures.  2-YEAR WARRANTY: Packed with safety features, the GOMO is kitted out with safe ABS plastic finishes for less scrapes to the bike… and your kids! Available in four different 2-Tone Color Combos, choose the one they think is the coolest! The GOMO also comes with a complete 2-year Manufacturing Warranty. ",

These brakes are especially handy for climbs and descents, and for a more consistent response in muddy or rocky terrain.  With disc brakes, this bike allows the use of wider tires for maximum traction in wet or dry conditions, and for greater rolling momentum. Wider tires increase momentum with less exertion, a characteristic you appreciate more, the further you ride.   The front suspension is precision-crafted for a responsive ride, while the 3-piece steel crank remains durable for many years of use. This bike 's enlarged headtube and angular-shaped rims complement this stylish bike with added performance.   The padded ATB saddle is designed for comfort and style, plus the quick-release binder clip makes it easy to adjust as needed.

The classic, trendy design of a beach cruiser but with the functionality of any hybrid, road or mountain bike. With seven speeds and handbrakes, you will have more versatility and power options than the standard Beach Cruiser offers. The Urban Lady Seven Speed uses a top-of-the-line Shimano shifting system with a derailleur that enables you to enjoy a more high intensity riding and to go farther distances than ever imagined possible on a cruiser. When you shift gears, the derailleur will cause the chain to change sprockets to move to a different gear. Gear one is the easiest to pedal and gear seven is the hardest. For example, gear one should be used for going uphill and riding at a slow controlled pace. With ranges in between for varied resistance, gear seven should be used for downhill and high speed riding. The Firmstrong 26-Inch Urban Lady Seven Speed Women’s Beach Cruiser also features both front and rear handbrakes operated via levers on the handlebars, allowing for fast braking down hills or at high speeds. The curve of the 15.5-inch steel frame is a classic cruiser design, with the top bar arching down to make it easier to step over and get on the Women’s Beach Cruiser Bicycle.

Other kids bikes are just shrunken down versions of adult bikes, so typically the grips are too large, the pedals are too wide and the seats are too big. On SmartStart bikes, the grips are smaller to match smaller hands, the gears are recalibrated for more power with less pedaling effort and the pedals are closer together to fit a child 's hips.
